**Summary** 

You, the player, suddenly enter a big castle and the door shuts behind you. There is only a wooden sign in front of you and some conveniently placed images and letters in the wall. You approach that wooden sign and suddenly it SPEAKS. Sir Woody the 3rd is his name and he is here to help you... Or is he really that "woody"?
